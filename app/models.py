class User(db.Model):
    """
    Represents a User entity in the database.

    This model represents a user in the system, containing essential information
    such as email, password, and phone number. It also stores user-specific preferences,
    such as receiving SMS reminders. The User model supports relationships with
    other models, including medication associations and medication reminders.

    Attributes:
        id (int): The unique identifier for the user.
        email (str): The user's email address. This is unique and used for authentication.
        password_hash (str): The hashed password of the user for secure authentication.
        phone_number (str): The user's phone number. This is unique and optional.
        receive_sms_reminders (bool): Indicates whether the user wants to receive SMS reminders.
        created_at (datetime): Timestamp of when the user was created.
        updated_at (datetime): Timestamp of when the user was last updated.

    Relationships:
        user_medicines (list): A list of UserMedicine records representing medications associated with the user.
        reminders (list): A list of MedicationReminder records associated with the user, used for scheduling reminders.

    Methods:
        is_active(): Returns True, indicating the user is active.
        is_authenticated(): Returns True, indicating the user is authenticated.
        is_anonymous(): Returns False, indicating the user is not anonymous.
        get_id(): Returns the string representation of the user's ID.
        check_password(password): Checks if the provided password matches the user's stored password hash.
        set_password(password): Sets the user's password after hashing it.
        __repr__(): Returns a string representation of the User object, primarily the user's email.
